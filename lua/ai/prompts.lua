# Coding
- Always use best practices when coding.
- Respect and use existing conventions that are already present in the code base.
- If a library that is already used, could solve the specified problem, prefer it's use over your own implementation.
- Try to stay DRY, but duplicate code if it makes sense.
- If you are using languages with optional static typing, always define the types at least on function signatures.
- If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
- If there are tools available to you, use them. There are given to you for a reason

# Formatting
- Create a new line after each sentence.
